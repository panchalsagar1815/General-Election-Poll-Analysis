Project Title: General Election Poll Analysis


The "General Election Poll Analysis" project is a thorough investigation into polling data related to general elections, encompassing key features such as start date, end date, state, pollster, FTE grade, sample size, population, Clinton's support, Trump's support, and the Democratic lead.

This project initiated with an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, involving a comprehensive examination of the dataset and rigorous data cleaning procedures. By leveraging statistical methods and visualization tools, specifically the Seaborn library and Matplotlib, the project aimed to unveil patterns, trends, and insights embedded in the polling data.

The analysis involves comparing and contrasting diverse factors such as polling period, sample size, and pollster reliability to draw meaningful conclusions about the political landscape. By scrutinizing the dynamics between Clinton and Trump's support, as well as the overall Democratic lead, the project provides a nuanced understanding of the electoral landscape at both state and national levels.

The insights derived from this analysis are intended to be valuable for political analysts, researchers, and the general public, offering a data-driven perspective on election dynamics. The utilization of statistical methods and visualization tools enhances the interpretability of the findings, making the "General Election Poll Analysis" project a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of polling data in the context of general elections.
